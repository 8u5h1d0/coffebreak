My first ever (functioning) program.

This shell script is extremely simple.

Clears your terminal without destroying scrollback, and displays a nice ascii and an AFK message.
While showing a timer to signal how long you've been AFK.

To end the timer (when back from being AFK) simply ctl+c to interrupt the timer.
